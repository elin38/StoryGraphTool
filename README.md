An exercise in building data-driven game design

## Features
- The use of a lock and key puzzle in the form of a quest. The player must accept a quest at the adventurers' guild and deliver a package to the Carpenters' Guild to unlock the "Northern Gate" link.
- A puzzel system that relies on an RNG to give players clues when they enter places designated as "Guilds".
- A location-specific interactive mechanism in the form of a prompt that goes along side the aforementioned puzzel.
